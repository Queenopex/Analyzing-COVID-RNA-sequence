# Analyzing-COVID-RNA-sequence

In this project, I was able to analyze the data on RNA sequences of COVID in two of its major variants: Delta and Omicron. 
RNA is a nucleic acid present in any living cell that has one strand consisting of various combinations of four nucleotides: uracil, cytosine, adenine, and guanine. 
RNA is the "source code" for COVID that enables the virus to enter the cell and replicate itself.
